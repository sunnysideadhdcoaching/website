# What is ADHD Life Coaching?

Hello Beautiful Brains! I'm Sunny Love, a certified ADHD Life Coach. Thanks for stopping by checking out my site. 

A neurodiverse mind is an amazing gift. Sure, we know that ADHD comes with some challenges. We've all been there. Taking steps to engage in finding your unique strengths, creating desired changes, and reaching self-determined goals, is all part of the Life Coaching journey. As a Life Coach, I see you as perfectly capable, complete, and creative human beings, with challenges that can be unique to people with ADHD. 

## What is ADHD Life Coaching?

ADHD coaching is walking beside a client in making the desired changes in their life. Life coaching focuses on the present time, the client's goals, supporting them in overcoming barriers in reaching their goals, and helping them find the answers in how the client will achieve their goals. 

## Not Sure You or a Loved One Have ADHD? 

Hey, no problem! I coach people with or without a formal ADHD diagnosis. 

ADHD is a relatively common diagnosis, but that doesn't mean it should be diagnosed lightly. To get diagnosed you or a family member need to be evaluated by a medical professional. An accurate and well-rounded diagnosis is a multi-step process including a clinical interview, a medical history review, and the completion of normed rating scales by loved ones, educators, and/or colleagues.
